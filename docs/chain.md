# Chain Mode

Chain Mode executes a list of requests sequentially with a shared `vars` store.

## Core actions
1. Add requests to the chain list.
2. Drag and drop to reorder.
3. `Run` executes all steps.
4. `Debug` enables step-by-step execution.
5. `Next` runs the next request in debug mode.

## Shared state
1. `vars` is shared across steps.
2. Logs accumulate in the chain logs panel.
3. Current state is shown in the chain state panel.
